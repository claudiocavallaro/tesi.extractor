The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of
a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more
positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk
show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably
made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech,
either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and
other non-speech-like tracks.

The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful
for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological
correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.

Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic
tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate,
and general entropy.

Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
